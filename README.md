Search momondo for flights on several dates in parallell

Because of Momondo's extensive use of javascript to load results, ChromeDriver (https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/) is required for this script to run.
At the moment no effort has been made to make this user friendly, so the easiest way to launch is to clone the repo and run <code>sbt start</code>.
Maybe a JAR will be uploaded in the future, but with the hard dependency on ChromeDriver it will never be plug and play.
